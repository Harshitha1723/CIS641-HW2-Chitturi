        <h2>Term Project - Diabetes Risk Prediction System</h2>
        <p>
            Diabetes is a widespread global health concern, often poorly understood. It results from elevated blood glucose levels due to the pancreas' inability to produce sufficient insulin or the body's inefficient use of it. This project focuses on data science, employing supervised machine learning for classifying individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic. Various classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine, were utilized, with K-Nearest Neighbors offering the highest accuracy. The research requires a comprehensive dataset encompassing factors like age, gender, family medical history, lifestyle choices (diet, exercise), and medical test results (e.g., blood glucose levels). Data sources can include publicly available health datasets, anonymized medical records, and tailored surveys.
